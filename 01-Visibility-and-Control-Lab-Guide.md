# PRISMA CLOUD VISIBILITY AND CONTROL BOOTCAMP


### Lab Introduction

Thank you for joining todayâ€™s Visibility and Control camp. The lab will focus on the ways
that Prisma Cloud can help you secure cloud assets through posture and compliance tools.

Before we begin the lab let's start with a brief overview of the scenario to help frame the
context.

### Scenario

The Exampli Corp, a mock corporation, is rushing to build a number of cloud based applications before their fiscal year ends.
Up against challenging deadlines, the development and infrastructure teams are working
around the clock to get their app built, tested, and released to hit their goals.

Fortunately, Exampli Corp recently integrated Prisma Cloud into their development lifecycle
adopting security from code to cloud. Once in production Exampli Corps operations
and security teams continue to leverage Prisma Cloud to monitor and protect runtime
resources, reduce the attack surface, and enforce least privilege.

Will The Exampli Corp team take the time to build a secure app? Or will the stress of rushing to complete their apps in time lead to mistakes?

### Exercise

#### Cloud Security Posture Management

The cloud allows organizations to build and run scalable applications with great agility and resilience. However, the cloud also presents unique security challenges. Ensuring applications and services are secure at runtime is a core responsibility for security teams. CSPM tools can reduce the burden on cloud security teams by automating routine security monitoring, audits and remediations, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority items and prevent configuration drift. 

In this section you will explore how Prisma Cloud can help security teams inventory the applications and services running in their multi-cloud footprint. 

1. Login to [Prisma Cloud](https://app3.prismacloud.io/login).

2. Use the credentials provided by your Instructor to authenticate.

3. Let's start with taking a look at the **Asset Inventory** page to get an idea of the scale of resources that are being monitored by this particular Prisma Cloud tenant.

4. Begin by clicking on the **Inventory** tab at the top and click on **Assets**.

5. The **Asset Inventory** is a helpful page in Prisma Cloud where teams can get a high level view of their cloud assets and their compliance with defined policies. Without constant visibility of what is being deployed in your cloud footprint, you cannot begin to secure it.

6. Your screen should look similar to the one below:

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/cloud-security-posture-management-4.png "Optional title")

7. Begin by clicking on **AWS** under the **Cloud** column.

Here you can see all of the EC2 Instances and associated details, including Alerts, Vulnerabilities and Account information.

11. Let's take a look at the **PANW-WebServer-awsjamconfig** Asset.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at3.45.29PM.png)

A sidecar window will open with an overview along with other tabs for investigation.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at3.46.54PM.png)


12. To learn more let's investigate the **Findings** tab.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at3.57.11PM.png)

Here you can see this EC2 instance is exposed to the internet and is not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2).


13. Next click on the **Attack Paths** tab to see a graphical view of the findings.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at4.04.53PM.png)

Explore the icons within the Attack Path graph. In the screenshots below we can see the assets that are exposed to the internet as well as the IMDSv2 misconfiguration.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at4.14.17PM.png)

14. Prisma Cloud keeps an inventory of alerts making it easy for security teams to prioritize the most important findings. 
15. Close the sidecar window by clicking the X at the top right of the screen and click on the **Alerts** tab at the top of the UI. 

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at4.24.07PM.png)

16. The **Overview** tab is an inventory of alerts with filtering capabilities to isolate what is most important. Feel free to try out the different filters. Admins are able to save filters to create customized views.

17. Next, let's take a look at the **Highest Priority** tab. This tab lists the highest priority alerts within the last 24 hours. If no findings are populated use the Time Range filter to increase the length of time. Keep this in mind moving forward. 

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at4.31.37PM.png)

18. Now let's click on the **Incidents** tab. The Incidents tab filters events that depend on audit/network logging and monitoring of runtime events via an agent. You will need to change the filter to **Past 6 months** for the following steps.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/Screenshot2024-02-13at5.23.29PM.png)

Click on the **Traffic from a suspicious IP address associated with Cryptominer activity** policy to expand the alerts and then click on an Alert ID to open a sidecar window to get an Overview, Anomaly Details and Recommendation for remediation.

In this section we explored the various filtered views of alerts discovered by Prisma Cloud. In the next section we will focus on Compliance. 

#### Compliance in the Cloud

Many organizations struggle maintaining a grasp on compliance in the cloud. Prisma Cloud supports compliance checks for IaC. Additionally, at runtime many assets are still vulnerable due to risky configurations and careless development practices.

With multiple upcoming compliance audits bearing down on Exampli's CISO's calendar it's time to begin reporting on what is in a failed state and what needs to be done to get the organization's cloud footprint compliant.

1. Start by clicking the **Compliance** tab at the top of the UI. This page provides a high level view of all the unique assets and their associated adherence to various compliance frameworks and policies. When Prisma Cloud detects a violation of a policy it generates an alert.

![Alt text for image](/screenshots/shift_left/compliance-in-the-cloud-1.png "Optional title")

2. Leverage the filters to adjust the results and select **AWS** for the **Cloud Type**. Refine the filters even more and select the compliance framework **MAS TRM 2021**. MAS TRM is a guideline that is generally adopted by Financial Institutes in Singapore, and often used as a compliance requirement.

3. Click on the Compliance Standard Name from the results to see which services have policies applied for that standard. Prisma Cloud provides a nice breakdown of each service type for easy referencing. 

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/pcs-compliance-2.png)

4. This provides a focused view of Exampli's AWS footprint and its adherence to this MAS TRM Standard.

Lets look into an example. Click on **Data and Infrastructure Security**, and click on the number *5* in the Policies Assigned column, which is on the same row as 11.2.4. 

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/pcs-compliance-3.png)

Look into the different policies assigned to this section, click on the **Alert** icon for the Policy **AWS Security Group allow all traffic on SSH port (22)**.

![](/screenshots/v-and-c/pcs-compliance-4.png)

5. Click on **AWS Security Group allows all traffic on SSH port (22)** and clikc on any of the **Alert ID**. A side window opens that provides an Overview, Recommendation, Asset Config and Alert Rules. Additionally, the alert can be sent to a third party integration, like JIRA, for automated ticket creation. Reports can also be generated so you'll be ready for the next assessment and audit.
