# Prisma Cloud Bootcamp
## Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks

### Introduction
As organizations scale their cloud footprints, they need to ensure both their cloud infrastructure and cloud native applications are secure. Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud is the industryâ€™s only comprehensive Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that delivers full lifecycle security and full stack protection for multi- and hybrid-cloud environments.

This workshop covers a quick overview on Prisma Cloud approach towards cloud security, and a hands on lab session that gives attendees a guided hands-on experience with Prisma Cloud platform. In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Monitor and manage security posture for multi- and hybrid-cloud environments
* Gain deep visibility, detect and prioritize respond to threats across multiple cloud environments
* Secure workload such as hosts, containers, and serverless across the application lifecycle
* Integrates vulnerability scanning and hardening checks into the CI/CD workflow
* Analyze the containerized apps for the runtime, vulnerability or compliance issue they contain

This workshop will be mainly carried out on a Prisma Cloud demo tenant. Minimally, you will need a laptop with good internet connection & a reliable browser. The access to the Prisma Cloud demo tenant would be read-only, hence the participant will not be able to make any changes to the environment.

To access the lab environment, you will need a credential from the lab instructor and access Prisma Cloud demo tenant [here](https://app3.prismacloud.io/login). Once done, you can move on to the lab [here](/01-Visibility-and-Control-Lab-Guide.md) to get started!
